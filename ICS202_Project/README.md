# Data Structure Project 

## Description
#### This Project is a program that implement the Trie data structure. It reads a file that contain a big number of words called dictionary, then, the program ask the user if user want to create Trie using help of these words or by adding new words from user. In case the user want to take advantage of the existance words, the user sould enter the charactars that should be contained in the words the user want it on the Trie. After this, the progtam will use the user input to find all the possible combination of the user charactars on the dictionary. After extracting the wanted words, the program finaly will insert these words in a way that suit the Trie structure. 

* All works done in a way that makes the program as efficient as possible
