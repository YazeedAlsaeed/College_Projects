# Analysis and Design Project (Producer Buyer)

# Description

#### Producer Buyer software system is a simple system that links the Producers (Vehicles Manufactures) with Buyers (Rental Companies). It basically helps the Producers publish their product and then notify the Buyers who are subscribed in the same published category. It uses a special software engineering design pattern called Broker architecture, responsible basically for controlling the flow of the system and separate each class from another to avoid any direct link and to make the whole system more secure and to hide and encapsulate classes.
